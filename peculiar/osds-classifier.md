## POST Request


Send your `POST` request to `https://oghub-rmscontextual-mi-p.ew.r.appspot.com/iabcategories?url=" + articleUrl`.

<br>
<br>


## Response



```json
{
  "data": {
    {
      "validUntil": 1692265049490,
      "requestId": "b00d7116212ac0514018c8941e8e2b55",
      "requestedAt": 1689673047895,
      "categories": {
          "Medical Health: 286": 0.5452159,
          "Health Insurance: 399": 0.9983974,
          "Personal Finance: 391": 0.93517065,
          "Insurance: 398": 0.99965286,
          "Business and Finance: 52": 0.43605074
      },
      "status": "DONE"
    }

  }
}
```

Please make sure that the categories object exists and is filled in the response.
Write the `res.data.categories` node into our adSSetup like this:

```javascript
adSSetup.iabTax = JSON.stringify(res.data.categories);
```


<br><br>


## Authentification

To send the request successfully, you have to authenticate. You can use the following token for this process:

```javascript
const {GoogleAuth} = require('google-auth-library');

const auth = new GoogleAuth();
const client = await auth.getIdTokenClient("325807998263-meo5591pc8ep2a02vf3fo25uoa152fia.apps.googleusercontent.com");
```

<br>

However, you have to use a `credentials.json` file. Contact the AdTechnology team via `adtechnology@axelspringer.com` to get a credentials.json file.

Also, please have a look [into this demo project](https://github.com/spring-media/adsolutions-osds-demo/blob/main/src/classifier.js), to see a basic working implementation of the API and the authentication.

## How to handle the output

Since there is no Adlib in apps, the process to handle the classifier output is a bit different between web and app.


### ðŸ’» Output for web 

The adlib will take care of analysing and structuring the data and as well will pass 
it to the adcalls. Publishers only have to provide the data via the adSSetup
inside an optional ```iabtax``` property:

```javascript
adSSetup.iabtax = {
    "Medical Health: 286":0.5452159,
    "Health Insurance: 399":0.9983974,
    "Personal Finance: 391":0.93517065,
    "Insurance: 398":0.99965286,
    "Business and Finance: 52":0.43605074
}
```

<br>

### ðŸ“± Output for apps 

Since there is no Adlib in apps, the process is a bit different here.<br>
For the apps, the publishers have to cover what the adlib is doing on the web.<br>
This means, that values below 0.5 have to be removed, as well as the non numeric characters<br>
from the keys needs to be stripped out to pass the data as customKeywords for the AdCalls:

```javascript
bannerview.addCustomKeywords("iabtax","286")
bannerview.addCustomKeywords("iabtax","391")
bannerview.addCustomKeywords("iabtax","398")
bannerview.addCustomKeywords("iabtax","399")
```
