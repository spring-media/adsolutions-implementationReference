Please add the following script immediate after the adSSetup

```

This `js` contains the whole Ad Library. Every website will get its own `js` from Axel Springer.

## Body Integration

### Fullscreen Video Container
Please put the following `div` on the page, where the fullscreen ad will be showed

```html
<div id="fullscreen"></div>
```

### IAB Ad Container
Please put the following `div` on the page, where the  ad will be showed

```html
<div id="slotted"></div>
```

### making use of responded ads
After the adcall is finished we will echo the result to the HTML by triggering an event:
```
    document.addEventListener("adInfo", function (adInfo) {
        let adSlot = adInfo.detail; // make sure to store the information per placement for later rendering
    });
```

To render an ad please trigger a "renderAd" event, e.g.:
```
    document.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent("renderAd", {"detail": `${adSlot.id}`})) // use stored information for placement
```
