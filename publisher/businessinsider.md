## Strategy

### Removing Internal Ad Components

To integrate AdLib correctly on BusinessInsider.com, **all internal ad components must be removed**. All ad placements and delivery should run through AdLib. To facilitate this transition, **we require full access** to analyze and configure the ad setup appropriately.

### Pagename Structure

AdLib will automatically support the existing pagename structure. No changes are required, as AdLib will handle pagename assignment and mapping within the ad server.

### Programmatic Advertising

Ensure that the `partners` flag in `adSSetup` is set to `true`, as this setting will activate all programmatic advertising, including Magnite and Amazon TAM. If you do not wish to use this setting, it is okay for us; we can activate programmatic across the entire website.

## Basic Setup

There are only three critical steps for a basic ad integration:

### 1. Include the AdLib

AdLib is the core component for ad delivery. It must be included in the **header** of the website, **as high as possible**, but **below the CMP stub**.

```html
<html>
<head>
    <title>Business Insider</title>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="https://www.asadcdn.com/adlib/pages/businessinsider.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
    <div class="your-content">...</div>
</body>
</html>
```

**Important**: Do **not** load AdLib asynchronously, as this can cause [cumulative layout shifts](https://github.com/spring-media/adsolutions-implementationReference/blob/master/cumulative-layout-shift.md) and revenue loss.

---

### 2. Configure AdSSetup

The `adSSetup` object acts as a configuration for ad delivery.

```html
<script type="text/javascript">
    adSSetup = {
        view: "d",
        partners: true,
        adPlacements: ["superbanner", "sky", "mrec"],
        adSlotSizes: { ... },
        placeholder: { ... },
        colorBg: true,
        bgClick: true,
        hasVideoPlayer: false,
        isArticle: true,
        pageName: "news_story",
        target: "value1;value2;value3;key1=value1,value2;key2=value1,value2;"
    }
</script>
```

For a detailed explanation of `adSSetup` parameters, see [this reference](https://github.com/spring-media/adsolutions-implementationReference/blob/master/general/adSSetup-in-detail.md).

#### AdSSetup.adSlotSizes - Desktop

```javascript
adSSetup = {
    "adPlacements": ["superbanner", "sky", "mrec", "mrec_btf"],
    "adSlotSizes": { 
        "superbanner": [{ "minWidth": 1, "sizes": [[728, 90], [728, 600]] }], 
        "sky": [{ "minWidth": 1, "sizes": [[160, 600], [120, 600], [300, 600]] }],
        "mrec": [{ "minWidth": 1, "sizes": [[300,250]] }],
        "mrec_btf": [{ "minWidth": 1, "sizes": [[300,250]] }],
    }
}
```

#### AdSSetup.adSlotSizes - Mobile

```javascript
adSSetup = {
    "adPlacements": ["mrec", "mrec_btf"],
    "adSlotSizes": { 
        "mrec": [{ "minWidth": 1, "sizes": [[320,160], [300,300], [300,250]] }],
        "mrec_btf": [{ "minWidth": 1, "sizes": [[320,160], [300,300], [300,250]] }],
    }
}
```

### 3. Provide Ad Slots

Ad containers must be provided for each requested ad placement.

```html
<div id="superbannerWrapper">
    <div id="superbanner"></div>
</div>
```

Once completed, your **basic AdLib integration is live**.
