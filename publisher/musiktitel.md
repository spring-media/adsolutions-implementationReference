# AdSSetup Documentation for Musikexpress, RollingStone & Metal-Hammer

In this documentation you find instructions on how to use the AdSSetup object to configure the ad delivery for your website.

## Ad Integration

Elements in the `<head>` of the website:

`<script type="text/javascript">`

## 1. Set the viewport of the website

Set view: "m" for mobile or "d" for desktop viewport.

`adSSetup = {view: "d",`

## 2. Switch for the 3th party scripts

We strictly recommend to set it as "false" only on pages for directsales campaign only to max out the revenue.

`	partners: true,`

## 3. Define Placements for your site

Please make sure that you only include placements you will add an adslot (div#adPlacementID) for the url the user has called.
Also please ensure you add the elements mainly in order they will appear in the website,
because the adserver will fill the first elements of each size with the must valueable campaigns.

`	adPlacements: ["superbanner", "billboard", "billboard_btf", "sky", "sky_btf", "mrec", "mrec_btf", "inpage"],`

### Notes

If you have infinite scrolling on a site, you can repeat _btf placements as much as you want. Keep in mind that an initial _btf placement needs to be defined like a normal placement in `AdPlacements` and `adSlotSizes`. In addition the initial _btf placement needs to exist in the ad server, too. Each incremented element is (if itself is not defined in adSSetup) a copy of the original _btf placement. Please use the following schema:
Example for 3 Medium Rectangle btf
- mrec_btf
- mrec_btf_2
- mrec_btf_3

For a deeper explanation please take a look into this documentation about our [onDemandAd-Integration](https://github.com/spring-media/adsolutions-implementationReference/blob/master/peculiar/onDemandAd-integration.md).

More info on [Placement Sizes](https://github.com/spring-media/adsolutions-implementationReference/blob/master/publisher-display-reference.md#4-define-the-sizes-for-every-ad-placement) and [Placement Codes](https://github.com/spring-media/adsolutions-implementationReference/blob/master/publisher-display-reference.md#3-define-the-ad-placements-for-the-website).

## 4. Define the sizes for every ad placement:

### Sizes for your channel

```
	adSlotSizes: {
		"superbanner": [{
			"minWidth": 1,
			"sizes": [[728,90],[728,600],[1000,600],[800,250],[970,250]]
		}],
		"billboard": [{
			"minWidth": 1,
			"sizes": [[800,250],[970,250]]
		}],
		"billboard_btf": [{
			"minWidth": 1,
			"sizes": [[800,250],[970,250]]
		}],
		"sky": [{
			"minWidth": 1,
			"sizes": [[160,600],[120,600],[300,600]]
		}],
		"sky_btf": [{
			"minWidth": 1,
			"sizes": [[160,600],[120,600],[300,600]]
		}],
		"mrec": [{
			"minWidth": 1,
			"sizes": [[300,250],[300,600]]
		}],
		"mrec_btf": [{
			"minWidth": 1,
			"sizes": [[300,250],[300,600]]
		}],
		"inpage": [{
			"minWidth": 1,
			"sizes": [[640,360],[1,1]]
		}],
	},
```
